# Analysis of Soil Degradation With Grazing 

## Introduction

In this project, I aim to replicate the graphs and data put forth by Takano et al. Specifically, I wish to replicate their ANOVA tests and their graphs of the time for the different weeks. Their study focused on the implications of rats observing others go through a maze and if it had an effect on their time to complete it and find the sucrose pellets. My goal for this project is to replicate their graphs, as well as additionally graph the difference in times for each group to show an average improvement level.

## Summary of Data to be Analyzed


### Studies have shown that rats are heavily influenced by the actions of others. They are a species that have been shown in studies to demonstrate empathy to other rats, as well as form intense social bonds. This study set out to see if rats were able to learn by observing others complete a task. This would determine the degree to which social learning affects their ability to navigate a maze in a quicker time with fewer errors. The findings of this study would further our understanding of learned behavior in rats, and potentially other species.

### They had 2 sets of rats. There were the demonstrator/observer and the individual/waiting. The first set had the observer watch the demonstrator then run the maze itself. The second had the waiting rat run the maze after the individual, but did not watch them. They then calculated the time to find all 4 pellets in the arm of the maze over 30 days after training.

### Type of data in this data set is time taken to complete the maze, days, and errors

#### Excel format

#### The data is 130 kB with 285 lines of code I can use

#### The first part of the data does not look usable due to how it was formatted, but it could still be fixed

## Detailed Description of Analysis to be Done and Challenges Involved

* Run an ANOVA
* Run means of each day for the types of rats
* Consolidate the group types of the rats into one
* Calculate the difference in means for each type
* Graph these differences
* Graph the per-day times
* Challenges:
  * The data is a bit haphazard and labeled confusingly
  * I will have to use a new type of analysis, the ANOVA
  * Making the graphs aesthetically pleasing
